# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Detection (SED) System  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Speech Emotion Detection (SED) System** is an AI-powered application that analyzes speech signals to identify the speaker's emotional state. Using deep learning and signal processing techniques, this system can recognize emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, neutral**, and more.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Real-time Emotion Detection** – Captures and analyzes live audio input.  
✅ **Multi-Class Emotion Recognition** – Supports multiple emotions like happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.  
✅ **Deep Learning-Based Model** – Utilizes machine learning techniques for accurate emotion classification.  
✅ **Feature Extraction from Speech** – Uses MFCCs, Chroma, Spectral Contrast, and more.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Optional GUI for better visualization.  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** TensorFlow/Keras, Librosa, OpenCV, PyAudio, Scikit-learn  
- **Dataset Used:** RAVDESS, TESS, CREMA-D, or custom datasets  
- **Model Type:** CNN, RNN (LSTM/GRU), or hybrid approaches
